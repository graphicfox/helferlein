# LABOR - Helferlein (Little Helper)
This package contains a number of helper functions and their typescript definitions. 
Not all implementations are written by us; all external, included code is annotated with it's source.

All helpers should be able to run in a node.js context, as well as in the browser and even a SSR context without any issues. 

## Documentation
The documentation / API is rendered in "./doc/index.html"
